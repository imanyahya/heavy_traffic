# Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94

In this project, we are going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the [I-94 Interstate highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_94).
The goal is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. For instance, we may find out that the traffic is usually heavier in the summer or when it snows.
